### Power Supply & Distribution

Provides stable power for the full radar system from a single 12 V source.

- **Input:** One 12 V DC supply feeds the entire system.
- **Limits:** Total average system power under 15 W.
- **Regulation:** Local converters used to generate 5 V and 3.3 V rails where needed.
- **Stability:** Motor activity or digital switching should not disturb RF or ADC performance.
- **Protection:** Basic protection against reverse polarity and excessive current.
- **Grounding:** Shared system ground maintained sensibly to avoid interference issues.
