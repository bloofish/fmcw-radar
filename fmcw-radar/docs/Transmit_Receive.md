### Transmission and Reception

Handles TX/RX of the radar signal. Antennas and layout must ensure clean transmission, isolation, and consistent returns.

- **Band:** 2.4–2.4835 GHz ISM.  
- **Antenna options (TX/RX):**  
  - **Yagi:** ~25–40° beamwidth, 7–10 dBi gain, compact and well-balanced.  
  - **Horn:** ~10–20° beamwidth, 10–15 dBi gain, high directivity and isolation.  
  - **Dish:** ~6–10° beamwidth, 15–20 dBi gain, long range but bulky.  
- **TX/RX setup:** Two matching directional antennas spaced and shielded for isolation.  
- **Isolation:** TX–RX coupling low enough to avoid receiver overload.  
- **Detectability:** Returns detectable at up to 10 m on standard targets.  
- **Impedance:** 50 Ω throughout; short runs, proper shielding between TX and RX.  
- **Mounting:** Antennas co-rotate; aligned to rotation axis and same polarisation.
